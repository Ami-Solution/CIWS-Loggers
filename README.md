#AggieWater Smart Water Metering Project

This repository contains files and documentation for a smart water metering solution developed by the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University using low cost, commercially available embedded computers and sensors. This system can turn most analog, positive displacement water meters with detachable register into a smart water meter with capabilities to store high frequency flowrate data for up to a week or more in a battery run.

#AggieWater Smart Water Metering Project

This repository contains files and documentation for a smart water metering solution being researched and developed by the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University using low cost commercially available computers and sensors. This system can turn most possitive displacement water meters with detachable register into a smart water meter with capabilities to store high frequency flowrate data for up to a week in a battery run.

## Cyberinfrastructure for Intelligent Water Supply

This repository contains files and documentation for a smart water metering effort under development at the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University. We are using low cost, commercially available, embedded computers and sensors to log data from existing analog residential water meters as well as commercial water meters with pulsed or current loop outputs (4-20 mA) on USU's campus. 

We are developing ways to turn most analog, positive displacement water meters with detachable registers into a smart water meter with capabilities to store high frequency flowrate data for up to a week or more in a battery run. We are also developing new cyberinfrastructure and techniques for collecting high frequency data from commercial water meters. 

The following is an example of the type of data we are collecting from individual residences:

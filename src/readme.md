#Source Code for AggieWater Smart Water Metering

This folder contains source code for two water meter data collection efforts created by the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University using low cost, commercially available embedded computers and sensors. We are conducting two residential water use studies for which we are collecting high frequency data:

1. **Residential Meters**:  For this effort we are using low cost, embedded computers and components to "piggy-back" on top of existing analog residential meters to collect high frequency data
2. **Campus Meters**: For this effort we have installed commercial water meters on residential buildings on USU's campus and are using low cost, embedded computers to log high frequency data from 4-20 mA or pulsed outputs on the meters.

#Source Code for AggieWater Smart Water Metering

This folder contains source code for two systems we are using to conduct to water meter data collection efforts. This code was created for execution on hardware created by the Utah Water Research Laboratory at Utah State University using low cost, commercially available embedded computers and sensors. The following are descriptions of the two systems:

1. **"Piggy-back" Loggers for Analog Meters**:  We are using low cost, embedded computers and components to "piggy-back" on top of analog, positive displacement water meters to collect high frequency data.

2. **Loggers for Current Output Meters**: For this effort we are using low-cost, embedded computers to log high frequency data from 4-20 mA or pulsed outputs on commercial water meters installed on residential buildings on USU's campus.
